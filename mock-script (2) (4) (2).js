Since both samples absorb the same amount of heat, qA = qB. Therefore, mA * cA * ΔTA = mB * cB * ΔTB. 10.0 g * cA * 38 °C = 20.0 g * cB * 23 °C. cA / cB = (20.0 * 23) / (10.0 * 38) = 460 / 380 = 1.21. Since cA/cB > 1, cA > cB.

     explanation: "I. Since the reaction is exothermic, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the amount of I₃⁻(aq). So, I is incorrect. II. Replacing KI with the same mass of NaI will add more moles of I⁻ because Na has a lower molar mass than K. This will shift the equilibrium to the right, increasing the amount of I₃⁻(aq).

Moles of electrons = Q/F = 1040C / 96485 C/mol = 0.01078 mol. Next, find the equivalent weight of the metal: Equivalent weight = mass deposited / moles of electrons = 0.408g / 0.01078 mol = 37.85 g/mol. The formula of the metal chloride is MCln. The molar mass of the chloride is twice the vapor density: 2 × 115 = 230 g/mol. The molar mass of MCln = Atomic weight of M + n * 35.5. We need to solve for the equivalent weight and therefore must determine n (the valency of the metal in the chloride). Now use the other relationship that Atomic Weight = Equivalent Weight × n, where n= 1,2,3. Atomic weight = 37.85× n = 154.8 when n is 4. Hence MCl4 is the metal chloride formula and the relative atomic mass of M is 154.8."

The molar mass of Iodine is 126.9 x 2 which is 253.9 g mol-1, there is 0.002 moles of iodine so therefore 0.002x 253.9 =0.51g of iodine is formed.

        explanation: "Animals with microlecithal eggs, which have very little yolk, typically require an extensive period of development inside the mother.

        correct: 2,
        explanation: "An organism with three embryonic layers is triploblastic. The presence of a partially lined body cavity, where the mesoderm does not completely surround the cavity, defines a pseudocoelomate. Thus the organism is a pseudocoelomate and triploblastic."

        explanation: "The presence of a coelom is the most relevant feature. Nematodes are pseudocoelomates (they have a partially lined body cavity), while flatworms are acoelomates (they lack a body cavity). Both groups are bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic."

        correct: 3,
        explanation: "The existence of diploblastic and triploblastic animals suggests a gradient in the development of tissue complexity. Diploblastic animals (like cnidarians) are considered more basal with only two tissue layers, while triploblastic animals have evolved a third layer, allowing for greater diversity and structural complexity. This suggests a step-wise pattern of evolutionary development."

        correct: 3,
        explanation: "The terms 'anterior' and 'posterior' refer to the front and back ends of bilaterally symmetrical animals, respectively. Radially symmetrical animals do not have a distinct head-tail orientation, as they are symmetrical around a central axis, making these terms irrelevant for them."

       correct: 1,
       explanation: "A new animal phylum with a mesoderm but no coelom would require reevaluation of our current classification. It does not fit existing categories as most animals with a mesoderm also have a coelom. This would suggest a new intermediate grouping such as an 'acoelomate triploblastic' or a 'mesoderm-only' classification is needed."

        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Such an organism with both symmetries would be very unusual and does not fit any of the classifications we currently have. This would likely require a new category to accommodate this novel body plan. Some animals, such as larval starfish have bilateral symmetry but then transition to radial symmetry as an adult."

The discovery of a new phylum with a coelom lined by both endoderm and mesoderm would mean we have to adjust our classification system and understanding of coelom development. This indicates that there may be different evolutionary paths than we previously thought, rather than old data being wrong."

       explanation: "The presence of a mesoglea-like substance in triploblastic animals would indicate that this type of structure is not exclusive to diploblastic animals. The discovery of a mesoglea-like substance in diverse groups of triploblastic organisms might indicate it evolved independently multiple times through convergent evolution, thus we would have to re-evaluate our understanding of evolutionary development."
