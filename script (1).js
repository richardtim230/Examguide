    explanation: "A nucleus that spontaneously decomposes is said to be radioactive. Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of radiation from an unstable atomic nucleus. A radionuclide is a specific type of atom that is radioactive, but radioactivity is the broader term describing the process. Reactive refers to a substance's tendency to participate in chemical reactions, while electropositive refers to an element's tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. Neither of these concepts relates directly to spontaneous nuclear decay."

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "We can solve this using an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Since Kp is given and we have the initial moles, we can set up an expression and solve it. The equilibrium expression is Kₚ = (P(HI))² / (P(H₂) × P(I₂)). Convert moles to partial pressures (PV=nRT) assuming ideal gas behavior. Since the volumes are the same, the mole ratios can be used directly in place of pressure ratio in the expression. Solve the resulting quadratic equation. The resulting moles of HI at equilibrium will be approximately 0.0780 mol."

    options: ["Addition of a catalyst", "Increasing the volume of the container", "Increasing the pressure by injecting PCl₅(g)", "Decreasing the temperature"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium shifts the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas. Since there are more moles of gas on the product side (2 vs 1), increasing the volume will increase the number of moles of Cl₂(g). A catalyst only changes reaction rate, not equilibrium position. Increasing pressure favors the side with fewer moles, and decreasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left (exothermic)."

    options: ["The equilibrium constant of the reaction is < 1", "The reaction is endothermic", "The reaction is exothermic", "The activation energy of the reaction is large"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "A slow reaction rate is typically due to a large activation energy. The activation energy is the minimum energy required for the reactants to overcome the energy barrier and initiate the reaction. A large activation energy means that fewer molecules have enough energy to react, leading to a slow reaction rate. While equilibrium constants and whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic affect equilibrium position, they don't directly determine reaction rate."

    options: ["Temperature is changed", "Concentration of reactant changes", "Pressure is changed", "A catalyst is added"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The rate constant (k) of a reaction is temperature-dependent. The Arrhenius equation, k = Ae^(-Ea/RT), shows the relationship between the rate constant, activation energy (Ea), temperature (T), and the pre-exponential factor (A). Changes in concentration of reactants affect reaction rate, but not the rate constant itself. Pressure changes affect reaction rate primarily for gaseous reactants. A catalyst changes the reaction mechanism, thereby altering the rate constant."

    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Doubling [A] and quadrupling the rate indicates a second-order dependence on [A] (rate ∝ [A]²). The lack of effect from doubling [B] indicates a zero-order dependence on [B] (rate ∝ [B]⁰ = 1). Therefore, the rate expression is Rate = k[A]²."

    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Let's denote the initial rate as R₁ = k[A]²[B]. When [A] is doubled and [B] is halved, the new rate R₂ = k(2[A])²(½[B]) = k(4[A]²)(½[B]) = 2k[A]²[B] = 2R₁. Therefore, the rate is doubled."

    options: ["a radionuclide", "radioactive", "reactive", "electropositive"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A nucleus that spontaneously decomposes is said to be radioactive. Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of radiation from an unstable atomic nucleus. A radionuclide is a specific type of atom that is radioactive, but radioactivity is the broader term describing the process. Reactive refers to a substance's tendency to participate in chemical reactions, while electropositive refers to an element's tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. Neither of these concepts relates directly to spontaneous nuclear decay."

    options: ["electron to a γ-particle", "neutron to a proton", "proton to neutron", "β-particle to energy"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Beta decay involves the conversion of a neutron into a proton within the nucleus. This process results in the emission of a beta particle (an electron) and an antineutrino to conserve charge and energy. Therefore, the net effect is a transformation of a neutron into a proton."

    explanation: "Alpha decay involves the emission of an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons (⁴₂He). Thus, the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) of the nucleus decreases by four units after alpha decay. The number of protons and neutrons individually can change, but the change in mass number is the most direct and consistent observation."

    explanation: "The equilibrium constant Kₚ is calculated using partial pressures for gaseous reactants and products. For the given reaction, Kₚ = (P(SO₃)) / (P(SO₂)(P(O₂))^(1/2)). Substituting the given partial pressures: Kₚ = (0.332) / (0.562 × (0.101)^(1/2)) ≈ 1.86. Therefore, the equilibrium constant is approximately 1.86."

    options: ["5.26", "9.09", "8.74", "11.56"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Sodium benzoate is the salt of a weak acid (benzoic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). To find the pH, we first need to find the Kb of the benzoate ion (C₆H₅COO⁻) using the relationship Kₐ × Kբ = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴. Kբ = Kw / Kₐ = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (6.5 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 1.54 × 10⁻¹⁰.

    options: ["0.0130 mol", "0.0780 mol", "0.0260 mol", "0.0146 mol"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "We can solve this using an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Since Kp is given and we have the initial moles, we can set up an expression and solve it. The equilibrium expression is Kₚ = (P(HI))² / (P(H₂) × P(I₂)). Convert moles to partial pressures (PV=nRT) assuming ideal gas behavior. Since the volumes are the same, the mole ratios can be used directly in place of pressure ratio in the expression. Solve the resulting quadratic equation. The resulting moles of HI at equilibrium will be approximately 0.0780 mol."

    options: ["Addition of a catalyst", "Increasing the volume of the container", "Increasing the pressure by injecting PCl₅(g)", "Decreasing the temperature"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium shifts the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas. Since there are more moles of gas on the product side (2 vs 1), increasing the volume will increase the number of moles of Cl₂(g). A catalyst only changes reaction rate, not equilibrium position. Increasing pressure favors the side with fewer moles, and decreasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the left (exothermic)."

    explanation: "A slow reaction rate is typically due to a large activation energy. The activation energy is the minimum energy required for the reactants to overcome the energy barrier and initiate the reaction.
