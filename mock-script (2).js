        correct: 1,
       explanation: "Meroblastic cleavage is characterized by incomplete cleavage furrows. The large amount of yolk inhibits the complete division of the cell, so only parts of the cytoplasm are divided. This is typically seen in eggs with lots of yolk."

        correct: 2,
       explanation: "Cell removal in early development can have different effects depending on whether the organism's cells are determinate (fate is fixed) or indeterminate (fate is flexible). In determinate species, cell removal usually prevents normal development, whereas in indeterminate species, the remaining cells can compensate."

        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Cell division during radial cleavage can result in cells of equal or unequal size, depending on the specific organism and its egg's yolk distribution. Cleavage in general occurs before gastrulation, so it does not happen only during gastrulation."

         correct: 3,
        explanation: "Uneven yolk distribution, such as in telolecithal eggs, can lead to unequal cleavage. This means that the cells in different parts of the egg will divide at different rates and end up with different sizes."

        explanation: "In microlecithal eggs, the repeated divisions form a structure called the blastodisc (a flat disk of cells), rather than the blastula stage found in eggs with more yolk. The yolk has a minimal effect on cleavage, leading to a blastodisc."

        explanation: "Animals with microlecithal eggs, which have very little yolk, typically require an extensive period of development inside the mother.

    correct: 3,
    explanation: "The presence of different embryonic layers (two in diploblastic, three in triploblastic) strongly suggests a common ancestor and a progression of developmental complexity over evolutionary time.  Diploblastic animals are simpler in body plan than triploblastic animals."
