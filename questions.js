        answer: "To achieve a lower energy state", 
        explanation: "Atoms bond to achieve a lower energy state by forming stable configurations.<br><br><strong>'To increase their atomic mass'</strong>: Incorrect, as bonding does not affect the atomic mass, which depends on protons and neutrons.<br><strong>'To become isotopes'</strong>: Incorrect, isotopes are formed by changes in the number of neutrons, not bonding.<br><strong>'To create free radicals'</strong>: Incorrect, free radicals are unstable species formed during chemical reactions, not bonding."
