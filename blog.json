    "title": "How I Managed My First Hostel Room (and My Crazy Roommates)",
    "excerpt": "<div class=\"flowbite-card\"><div class=\"p-6\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">How I Managed My First Hostel Room (and My Crazy Roommates)</h2><p>Before I gained admission, I used to daydream about university hostel life. I pictured myself in a neat little room, maybe a small plant by the window, and late-night gists with friends over noodles. But let me just say—reality humbled me! Nothing prepares you for hostel wahala in a Nigerian university, especially when you have to share a room with complete strangers.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Arrival Day: Welcome to the Jungle</h3><p>I still remember the day I moved into Awo Hall at OAU. My mum helped me carry my Ghana-must-go bag, stepping carefully to avoid the puddles on the hostel walkway. Everywhere was buzzing—students dragging boxes, parents shouting instructions, and porters yelling, “Next!” My heart was pounding. “Aisha, you go survive this one?”</p><p>When I entered my assigned room, I met three faces staring at me like I was a new character in a TV show. There was Ada, already arranging her clothes with military precision; Sade, on her bed, blasting music and eating gala; and Zainab, quietly reading a novel in the corner. I greeted, “Good afternoon!” and they replied with varying levels of enthusiasm.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Space Wahala</h3><p>First problem: space. Our room was small, with four bunks squeezed together, and everyone came with luggage as if we were relocating for five years. Ada had two huge boxes and a suitcase. Sade, I don’t even know how she fit all her shoes and bags. Zainab was the minimalist, just one bag and a stack of books. I squeezed my things into a corner and prayed nobody would “mistakenly” borrow my provisions.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Roommate Drama Begins</h3><p>The first week was all about setting ground rules. Ada wanted the room swept every morning before 7am. Sade didn’t care—she’d play music at any hour, and sometimes her friends would come in, laughing loudly late at night. Zainab was always reading and didn’t like noise, but she never complained. Me? I just tried to blend in and avoid wahala.</p><p>One night, Sade’s friends came over and started dancing shaku shaku, shaking the bunks so much I thought the whole room would collapse. Ada shouted, “Please, some of us have 8am lectures!” Sade just increased the volume. The next morning, Ada swept angrily and warned, “Anybody that cannot keep to rules should look for another room!” Tension dey.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Hostel Survival Hacks</h3><ul class=\"list-disc ml-6\"><li><strong>Padlock everything:</strong> If you leave your Milo or chin chin out, just say goodbye. Provisions move mysteriously in hostels!</li><li><strong>Mark your bucket:</strong> If you don’t write your name on your bucket, it will grow legs and disappear to another block.</li><li><strong>Always have extension box:</strong> Four people, one socket—na fight be that. My extension box became my most prized possession.</li><li><strong>Earplugs are life-savers:</strong> With Sade’s music and Ada’s early morning alarms, I had to invest in good earplugs if I wanted any sleep.</li><li><strong>Respect people’s space:</strong> I learned to ask before borrowing anything, and to always return it—even if it’s just a spoon.</li></ul><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Bonding Moments</h3><p>It wasn’t all stress, sha. There were nights we’d gist till 2am, sharing stories about secondary school crushes, village Christmas, and hostel crushes (that one na secret!). Sometimes, we’d cook noodles together and laugh about our lecturers’ funny accents. Zainab eventually dropped her shyness and joined our talks, surprising us with her wicked sense of humor.</p><p>During exam week, the room transformed. Ada became the “mummy,” making sure everyone ate and slept. Sade would boil water for us to bathe early, and Zainab would quiz us with past questions. We formed a small family, looking out for each other—even when we fought over who left the bathroom wet.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Unforgettable Hostel Memories</h3><p>My first harmattan in the hostel, we all huddled together for warmth and shared shawls. The day NEPA took light for two days straight, we turned it into a campfire night, telling ghost stories by torchlight and laughing until we cried. When Ada’s birthday came, we threw her a surprise party with biscuits, sweets, and a homemade card.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Life Lessons I Learned</h3><ul class=\"list-disc ml-6\"><li><strong>Patience and tolerance:</strong> Living with different people isn’t easy, but you learn to understand and accept their quirks.</li><li><strong>Communication is key:</strong> Don’t bottle up issues. Talk it out, even if it means a small argument now and then.</li><li><strong>Share and care:</strong> Sometimes, giving a little—like sharing your last sachet of milk—builds strong friendships.</li><li><strong>Laugh at the madness:</strong> Hostel life is chaotic, but it’s also what makes university memorable.</li></ul><p class=\"mt-6\">Now, when I look back, I realize those hostel days were some of the best times of my life. The noise, the fights, the laughter, even the missing buckets—all part of the journey. If you’re about to stay in a hostel for the first time, my advice is simple: go with an open mind, prepare for small wahala, and enjoy every moment. You’ll come out with stories you’ll tell for years—just like me.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Balancing Academics and Side Hustles: My Secret Formula",
    "excerpt": "<div class=\"flowbite-card\"><div class=\"p-6\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Balancing Academics and Side Hustles: My Secret Formula</h2><p>If you’ve ever tried to juggle classes and a side hustle in a Nigerian university, you’ll know it’s not beans at all! When I first got into OAU, I thought all I had to do was face my books, attend lectures, and maybe join one or two clubs. But after just one semester, I realized: pocket money finishes fast, and “broke” is not a good look. That’s how my journey into the world of side hustles began.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Wake-Up Call</h3><p>It was my first semester, and I had just finished buying textbooks, handouts, and—of course—gala and La Casera for lunch. I checked my account balance and almost fainted. I called my mum, and she said, “Aisha, you have to learn how to manage what you have. University is not for spending anyhow.” That was the day I decided, “No more waiting for monthly allowance. I must find a way to make my own money.”</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">My First Hustle: Thrift Queen</h3><p>My first side hustle was selling thrift clothes. I had a knack for spotting nice “okrika” at the market, so I started buying cute tops and jeans, washing and ironing them, and advertising on my WhatsApp status. My first customer was my roommate, then her friends, then people from my department. Before I knew it, I was making small, steady profit. Whenever someone complimented my outfit, I’d just smile and say, “I fit run am for you!”</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Balancing Act</h3><p>But balancing school and hustle wasn’t easy. There were days when I’d have 8am lectures, a test in the afternoon, and still need to deliver clothes in the evening. My bag was always heavy—books, calculator, and a nylon of tops for delivery. I had to learn the art of time management, fast! I bought a small planner and started writing down everything: lectures, assignment deadlines, market runs, and customer meet-ups.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Learning the Hard Way</h3><p>Of course, there were days I nearly crashed. One time, I stayed up late tagging clothes for an Instagram sale, only to oversleep and miss a quiz. Another time, I forgot to submit an assignment because I was busy answering customers’ DMs. After that, I made a rule: academics first, hustle second. I started blocking out “study hours” for myself, no matter how tempting the sales were.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Discovering Multiple Streams</h3><p>As time went on, I tried other hustles too. I baked small chops for birthdays, did freelance writing for blogs, and even became a campus brand ambassador for a phone company (free T-shirts and small stipends, but it added up!). Each hustle came with its own wahala—late payments, difficult customers, and sometimes, pure exhaustion. But each one also taught me a new skill.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Support System</h3><p>I can’t lie, my friends were my biggest support. Sometimes they’d help me deliver orders or remind me about schoolwork. We created a “hustle group chat” where we shared tips, helped each other with assignments, and even pooled money for bulk purchases. There’s something about hustling together that makes the stress feel lighter.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">What Helped Me Succeed</h3><ul class=\"list-disc ml-6\"><li><strong>Time management:</strong> I learned to use alarms, planners, and reminders. If you don’t plan, you’ll end up overwhelmed.</li><li><strong>Prioritizing:</strong> I never let my hustle get in the way of important tests or deadlines. If it meant telling a customer to wait, so be it.</li><li><strong>Asking for help:</strong> I wasn’t afraid to ask friends for support, whether it was covering a class or helping with deliveries.</li><li><strong>Rest and self-care:</strong> I learned the hard way that burning out helps no one. I scheduled time to relax and recharge, even if it was just with a movie or music.</li><li><strong>Learning to say “no”:</strong> Sometimes, I had to turn down a gig or customer if it clashed with my studies. It was hard, but necessary.</li></ul><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Payoff</h3><p>Balancing school and hustle wasn’t just about the money (though, let’s be honest, buying my own data and snacks felt great!). It gave me confidence, taught me discipline, and helped me discover talents I never knew I had. Now, when people ask how I manage, I just smile and say, “It’s all about planning, passion, and knowing when to rest.”</p><p class=\"mt-6\">So if you’re thinking of starting a side hustle while in school, go for it—but don’t let your grades suffer. Hustle smart, not just hard. And remember, your dreams are valid—one small gig at a time!</p></div></div>",
