    "excerpt": "<div class=\"flowbite-card\"><div class=\"p-6\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Balancing Academics and Side Hustles: My Secret Formula</h2><p>If you’ve ever tried to juggle classes and a side hustle in a Nigerian university, you’ll know it’s not beans at all! When I first got into OAU, I thought all I had to do was face my books, attend lectures, and maybe join one or two clubs. But after just one semester, I realized: pocket money finishes fast, and “broke” is not a good look. That’s how my journey into the world of side hustles began.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Wake-Up Call</h3><p>It was my first semester, and I had just finished buying textbooks, handouts, and—of course—gala and La Casera for lunch. I checked my account balance and almost fainted. I called my mum, and she said, “Aisha, you have to learn how to manage what you have. University is not for spending anyhow.” That was the day I decided, “No more waiting for monthly allowance. I must find a way to make my own money.”</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">My First Hustle: Thrift Queen</h3><p>My first side hustle was selling thrift clothes. I had a knack for spotting nice “okrika” at the market, so I started buying cute tops and jeans, washing and ironing them, and advertising on my WhatsApp status. My first customer was my roommate, then her friends, then people from my department. Before I knew it, I was making small, steady profit. Whenever someone complimented my outfit, I’d just smile and say, “I fit run am for you!”</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Balancing Act</h3><p>But balancing school and hustle wasn’t easy. There were days when I’d have 8am lectures, a test in the afternoon, and still need to deliver clothes in the evening. My bag was always heavy—books, calculator, and a nylon of tops for delivery. I had to learn the art of time management, fast! I bought a small planner and started writing down everything: lectures, assignment deadlines, market runs, and customer meet-ups.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Learning the Hard Way</h3><p>Of course, there were days I nearly crashed. One time, I stayed up late tagging clothes for an Instagram sale, only to oversleep and miss a quiz. Another time, I forgot to submit an assignment because I was busy answering customers’ DMs. After that, I made a rule: academics first, hustle second. I started blocking out “study hours” for myself, no matter how tempting the sales were.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Discovering Multiple Streams</h3><p>As time went on, I tried other hustles too. I baked small chops for birthdays, did freelance writing for blogs, and even became a campus brand ambassador for a phone company (free T-shirts and small stipends, but it added up!). Each hustle came with its own wahala—late payments, difficult customers, and sometimes, pure exhaustion. But each one also taught me a new skill.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Support System</h3><p>I can’t lie, my friends were my biggest support. Sometimes they’d help me deliver orders or remind me about schoolwork. We created a “hustle group chat” where we shared tips, helped each other with assignments, and even pooled money for bulk purchases. There’s something about hustling together that makes the stress feel lighter.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">What Helped Me Succeed</h3><ul class=\"list-disc ml-6\"><li><strong>Time management:</strong> I learned to use alarms, planners, and reminders. If you don’t plan, you’ll end up overwhelmed.</li><li><strong>Prioritizing:</strong> I never let my hustle get in the way of important tests or deadlines. If it meant telling a customer to wait, so be it.</li><li><strong>Asking for help:</strong> I wasn’t afraid to ask friends for support, whether it was covering a class or helping with deliveries.</li><li><strong>Rest and self-care:</strong> I learned the hard way that burning out helps no one. I scheduled time to relax and recharge, even if it was just with a movie or music.</li><li><strong>Learning to say “no”:</strong> Sometimes, I had to turn down a gig or customer if it clashed with my studies. It was hard, but necessary.</li></ul><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">The Payoff</h3><p>Balancing school and hustle wasn’t just about the money (though, let’s be honest, buying my own data and snacks felt great!). It gave me confidence, taught me discipline, and helped me discover talents I never knew I had. Now, when people ask how I manage, I just smile and say, “It’s all about planning, passion, and knowing when to rest.”</p><p class=\"mt-6\">So if you’re thinking of starting a side hustle while in school, go for it—but don’t let your grades suffer. Hustle smart, not just hard. And remember, your dreams are valid—one small gig at a time!</p></div></div>",
