        question: "Which separation technique is most suitable for separating a mixture of two volatile liquids with a large difference in boiling points?",
        options: ["Simple Distillation", "Fractional Distillation", "Sublimation", "Chromatography"],
        answer: "Simple Distillation",
        explanation: "<b>Correct Answer:</b> Simple Distillation<br>Simple distillation is used when the boiling point difference between two volatile liquids is greater than 25°C. It separates the liquids based on their boiling points.<br><br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b><br><b>Fractional Distillation:</b> Fractional distillation is used for separating liquids with close boiling points (less than 25°C difference).<br><b>Sublimation:</b> Sublimation is used to separate solids that sublimate directly into gas, not volatile liquids.<br><b>Chromatography:</b> Chromatography is used for separating components of a mixture based on their movement through a stationary phase, not for volatile liquid mixtures."
